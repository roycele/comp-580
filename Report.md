# Game: Pitching Angry Birds

Description: This is an Angry Birds style game that was built for blind kids. It consists of a series of 6 levels and try to accumulate the highest score possible. Using sound pitches, the player will try to get a relative idea of the angle and power that they shoot each bird (i.e. a higher pitch is a higher angle and power, and vice versa). There are instructions on the first page of the game. Our goal is to help the blind kids associate pitch with changing variables, and help develop a keen sense of hearing different pitches to help them in the real world.

Intended audience: Kids with blindness

Technologies/Frameworks/Libraries: We built this web application using JavaScript and HTML files. Using AudioContext and SpeechSynthesisUtterance we added sound components to the game that made beeping noises and a speech narration of the game. We used source code called BoxBox as the tool for the game physics to work (The link can be found in the works cited below).

Build/Deploy: We built it using a code-editor (VS Code) and used GitHub as a means of collaborating on the project. It's deployed using GitHub Pages, but must be played on a Google Chrome browser in order to work correctly. The app can be found at: roycele.github.io/comp-580

Problems encountered: We had trouble deploying on other browsers. Also, we couldn't fix the size of the playing screen, which isn't much of a problem to the visually impaired, but would have been more pleasing for those who could see and are helping out with the game. Sometimes the audio would play upon a page loading, and sometimes it didn't.

Future work: Future work would include adding more levels of increasing complexity. That may also include adding different types of birds and different types of enemies. In addition, due to Covid-19 restrictions, the intended audience was not able to play the game, so future work would include more testing with kids with blindness to make sure they're able to fully enjoy the game and continue to debug.
